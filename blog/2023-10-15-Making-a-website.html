Sure, as a kid I built some then-state-of-the-art raw html and css, but the industry has moved a little bit since then. Working as part of a team, I&#x27;ve gained lots of experience in building the actual content and layout, but basically haven&#x27;t ever done any DevOps - and frankly, it doesn&#x27;t spark joy. I don&#x27;t really know how to host a node server, and I don&#x27;t really know how to host a headless server.

Plus, I want things to be templatable, for example this (and all the other blog posts). To do that I&#x27;m using Vike, a static rendering framework for Vite, which is like Webpack but quick. Vite and typescript React is my standard stack for web, so having a SSR that uses that rather than having to totally change baseline is pretty good going by my counting.</div><div class="_text_18bf1_11" style="--grid-row:5">As lovely as <span class="_mono_1soan_1">pink</span>, <span class="_mono_1soan_1">orange</span>, <span class="_mono_1soan_1">yellow</span> and <span class="_mono_1soan_1">seagreen</span> are, obviously they aren&#x27;t the final colours (unless you&#x27;re here quite early). I tend to dump random colours onto things so that I can figure out what&#x27;s what, and build out the actual look and feel later. Similarly, the font has been updatd, and I imagine that I&#x27;ll need to change sizings and spacings as well. One thing that won&#x27;t need updating (much) is the left menu, which already responsively becomes a slide-in hamburger menu on mobile.</div><div class="_image_18bf1_16 _content_1bn2y_1" style="--grid-start:5;--grid-end:7"><img src="/website/blog/blog2.png" alt="A recursive picture of this blog post at the time of writing"/><label>The current state of laying out a blog (and some self-indulgant stupidity)</label></div><div class="_text_18bf1_11" style="--grid-row:6">And one of the reasons I wrote this blog post, was to test the blog rendering code - this is all json that gets loaded at compile time to spit out a page.
