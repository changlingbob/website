I love Warhammer names.","The new Warhammer has being announced, and slowly but surely we're finding out what the new edition looks like. One thing it doesn't look like it having Beasts of Chaos in it.","Wait, that's my army!","Ok so there's other things that are leaving the range. Beasts of Chaos in many ways aren't a surprise - almost the entire range is from back when Warhammer was Warhammer Fantasy - but also leaving is fully half the Stormcast range, poster children for Warhammer: Age of Sigmar, as well as Bonesplitter Orcs (another Old World hanger-on), some early Warcry warbands, and a bunch of Skaven (presumably soon to be replaced with fancy new models due to being the new editions focus). This has all made some people pretty reasonably upset.","As it happens, I'm pretty sanguine about this. As the saying goes, 'rules are temporary, models are forever'; but even ignoring that, Games Workshop committed to having rules for the next year - so actually the range isn't getting deprecated now, it's getting deprecated next summer. Even then, a bunch of my goats are Tzaangor, they slot straight into Disciples of Tzeentch, another army that still exists. Gors are relatively good as Karic Acolytes, a Bray Shaman is a wizard, we're all good.","Alternatively, Gors and Bestigor fit pretty well as Bloodbound in Khorne, or as marauders and chaos warriors in Slaves to Darkness, or I'm sure other things people will find soon enough. I'm less aware of Stormcast as a faction, but I'm sure Sequitors can be Liberators and Evocators can be Palladors. Bonesplitters.","Selfishly, I also expect this isn't the end of goats. Tzaangor and Slaangor are still around, with Slaangor being relatively new. I would expect Khorgor and Pestigor to show up again in the not too distant future, and there's a bunch of lore in AoS about the beastplague, a concept that turns people into beasts. I wouldn't be surprised if that faction rose from the ashes of beasts of chaos, cutting the direct connection to old Beastmen, but still holding on to the concept of an army of goat people.","Obviously this is extreme wishlisting, but there feels like a germ of a thing there, whereas Stormcast feels like an alignment with where the lore ended up wanting to be; Slave to Darkness found their footing for mortals, not needing the Warcry warbands any more; Bonesplitters."]}},"urlPathname":"/blog/2026-04-13-Squats-goats","abortReason":"!undefined","_urlRewrite":null,"_urlRedirect":"!undefined","abortStatusCode":"!undefined","_abortCall":"!undefined","_pageContextInitIsPassedToClient":"!undefined","_pageId":"/pages/blog/@id","data":"!undefined"}
