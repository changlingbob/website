    "It's the first day of the new year, so it's traditional to make resolutions. This is less of a singular resolution, and more of a precap: what I want to do with the year, and maybe next year we'll grade my progress (let's not though). Let's dig in.",
    "@monster-manager-title.png:Video games!:The current home screen of the video game I'm making",
    "I'm making a video game! I have been for years! I tried last year to get a working alpha demo various times, but never stuck the landing. I've got the tickets to work on, but still need to actually finish things up. I want to: * Release the alpha demo to a few friends to get proper feedback * Rebuild my content writing tool so that I can start writing the story * Release the procedural content writing tech on npm * And update this website with pages for all of these things * This also probably includes getting this website to a quality and remove the beautiful debug colours, so that I can feel sensible actually linking to it from npm.",
    "@troggoths.jpg:My Gloomspite Gitz:My Warhammer models I painted last year - a variety of trolls, some goblins riding squigs, and a pair of endless spells",
    "Last year I managed six months of painting a whole warhammer unit a month, and ended up with a 1000 point army of trolls. Then I put some goat-bird-men on my painting desk, and they're still there. The warhammer goals are: * Finish my 2000pts of beastmen * Extend the trolls to 2000pts * Keep my miniature golf score below zero (ie: paint more models than I buy) * I'd like to paint a third army, either 40k or just a third for AoS, but honestly getting this far would be fine for the year",
    "No picture for this one, but I want to get better at my dance classes. Currently I'm technically competent, but can't improvise well enough to manage through a whole song without panicking. Relatedly, I want to actually get back to exercising - whether that's hybrid calisthenics through their app, Ring Fit on the switch, cycling, getting back to climbing or something else I don't think is too important as much as just doing some kind of fitness beyond dancing once a week.",
    "Also relatedly, my friends have been really encouraging me to pick my saxophone back up again, and I want to even though I feel like I'd be way behind what I can or should be, but I've not played since I was 16, so I don't know why I'm expecting myself to be immediately competent, even at the level that I was then. That was 20 years ago!",
    "Finally, maybe, I want to actually document my progress. Here I am with some perfectly mid blog software, I should actually try and update it regularly. Maybe, if we're lucky, I'll actually attach an RSS feed, but I wouldn't get my hopes up if I were you."
