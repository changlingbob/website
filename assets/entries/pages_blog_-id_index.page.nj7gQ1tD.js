Let's dig in.","@monster-manager-title.png:Video games!:The current home screen of the video game I'm making","I'm making a video game! I have been for years! I tried last year to get a working alpha demo various times, but never stuck the landing. I've got the tickets to work on, but still need to actually finish things up. I want to: * Release the alpha demo to a few friends to get proper feedback * Rebuild my content writing tool so that I can start writing the story * Release the procedural content writing tech on npm * And update this website with pages for all of these things * This also probably includes getting this website to a quality and remove the beautiful debug colours, so that I can feel sensible actually linking to it from npm.","@troggoths.jpg:My Gloomspite Gitz:My Warhammer models I painted last year - a variety of trolls, some goblins riding squigs, and a pair of endless spells","Last year I managed six months of painting a whole warhammer unit a month, and ended up with a 1000 point army of trolls. Then I put some goat-bird-men on my painting desk, and they're still there. The warhammer goals are: * Finish my 2000pts of beastmen * Extend the trolls to 2000pts * Keep my miniature golf score below zero (ie: paint more models than I buy) * I'd like to paint a third army, either 40k or just a third for AoS, but honestly getting this far would be fine for the year","No picture for this one, but I want to get better at my dance classes. Currently I'm technically competent, but can't improvise well enough to manage through a whole song without panicking. Relatedly, I want to actually get back to exercising - whether that's hybrid calisthenics through their app, Ring Fit on the switch, cycling, getting back to climbing or something else I don't think is too important as much as just doing some kind of fitness beyond dancing once a week.","Also relatedly, my friends have been really encouraging me to pick my saxophone back up again, and I want to even though I feel like I'd be way behind what I can or should be, but I've not played since I was 16, so I don't know why I'm expecting myself to be immediately competent, even at the level that I was then. That was 20 years ago!","Finally, maybe, I want to actually document my progress. Here I am with some perfectly mid blog software, I should actually try and update it regularly.

To be fair, this is after a few weekends of work, and obviously several years of doing this for a living.","I have a lot of experience with websites, but I've never built (an interesting) one from scratch. Sure, as a kid I built some then-state-of-the-art raw html and css, but the industry has moved a little bit since then. Working as part of a team, I've gained lots of experience in building the actual content and layout, but basically haven't ever done any DevOps - and frankly, it doesn't spark joy. I don't really know how to host a node server, and I don't really know how to host a headless server. So I did what every good programmer should do, and ignored all of that in favour of just doing raw html and css (and js), but I did do it the complicated way.","As much as not having any javascript is appealing, sometimes you want some nice animations and realistically I want to write in React, as it's what I'm used to. Plus, I want things to be templatable, for example this (and all the other blog posts). To do that I'm using Vike, a static rendering framework for Vite, which is like Webpack but quick. Vite and typescript React is my standard stack for web, so having a SSR that uses that rather than having to totally change baseline is pretty good going by my counting.","@blog2.png:The current state of laying out a blog (and some self-indulgant stupidity):A recursive picture of this blog post at the time of writing","As lovely as `pink`, `orange`, `yellow` and `seagreen` are, obviously they aren't the final colours (unless you're here quite early). I tend to dump random colours onto things so that I can figure out what's what, and build out the actual look and feel later. Similarly, the font has been updatd, and I imagine that I'll need to change sizings and spacings as well. One thing that won't need updating (much) is the left menu, which already responsively becomes a slide-in hamburger menu on mobile.","And one of the reasons I wrote this blog post, was to test the blog rendering code - this is all json that gets loaded at compile time to spit out a page. I probably should have looked into markdown, but I want a bit more flexibility for layouts than markdown gives me. I'm going to pinch some of it's sytax for my own purposes though, when I eventually get to adding headings and suchlike.
